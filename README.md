## Description
LeapMailr is a tool that helps businesses manage user inquiries from their website's 'Contact Us' forms. When a user submits a message through a website's 'Contact Us' form, LeapMailr captures the inquiry and securely transmits it to the intended recipient's email inbox. This process is automated, so there's no need for manual intervention or forwarding of messages.

LeapMailr ensures that the email transmission is secure, protecting sensitive information from being intercepted or compromised during transmission. This is especially important for businesses that handle confidential information, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, and legal firms.

By using LeapMailr, businesses can streamline their communication process, reduce response times, and improve customer satisfaction. It also helps ensure that inquiries are directed to the appropriate recipient, reducing the risk of messages being overlooked or lost in email threads.
